Pierre is a multidisciplinary scientist, exploring the links between climate change and biodiversity over long time scales through numerical modelling. Pierre holds a MSc in agronomy engineering (AgroParisTech) and a MSc in paleontology (University of Montpellier). After working at reconstructing past environments of Southeast Asia, he completed a PhD in modelling past climates of Africa at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnement (Institut Pierre-Simon-Laplace) and the University of Poitiers. 

After a two-year postdoc in the climate modelling group at UC Santa Cruz, Pierre was hired in 2010 as a full-time researcher at CNRS. His current project aims at understanding the links between paleogeography, climate changes and biodiversity through time, his core tool being numerical climate models.

Pierre is co-head of the climate modelling team (CLIM) at LSCE, and responsable for the French paleoclimate modelling computing project, operating 50+ millions hours on French supercomputers. 

Recently, he expanded his activity towards history and sociological sciences, exploring the changes in the structuration of research in his own laboratory in the context of global climate change.
