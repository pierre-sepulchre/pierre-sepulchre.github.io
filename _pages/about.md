I am a multidisciplinary scientist, exploring the links between climate changes and biodiversity over long time scales through numerical modelling. After working at reconstructing past environments of Southeast Asia, I completed a PhD in modelling past climates of Africa at the <a href="https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/" target="_blank" >Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnement</a> (Institut Pierre-Simon-Laplace, <a href="https://cmc.ipsl.fr/" target="_blank" >IPSL</a>) and the University of Poitiers. 

After a two-year postdoc in the climate modelling group at UC Santa Cruz, I was hired in 2010 as a full-time researcher at CNRS. My current project aims at understanding the links between paleogeography, climate changes and biodiversity through time, my core tool being the Earth System Model IPSL-CM5A2, that we <a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/3011/2020/" target="_blank" >published in 2020</a>.

I am a member of the <a href="https://paleoclim-cnrs.github.io/" target="_blank" >French Deep-Time Paleoclimate Modeling Group</a>, and co-head of the <a href="https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/en/Phocea/Vie_des_labos/Ast/ast_groupe.php?id_groupe=82" target="_blank" >climate modelling team at LSCE</a>. I am also in charge of the French paleoclimate modelling computing project, operating 50+ millions hours on French supercomputers through <a href="https://www.genci.fr/en" target="_blank">GENCI</a>.
